JMS JavaScript Demo for iOS and Android App Development with Apache Cordova
===========================================================================

This demo helps you build your own JavaScript based iOS or Android applications using Apache Cordova.  This folder contains scripts to copy a JavaScript JMS demo application into your iOS or Android development environment. These scripts require that you specify a number of parameters to ensure that the correct files are copied to the appropriate locations.

Important
=========
Do not run these scripts before reading the documentation on how to deploy a JavaScript JMS app as a hybrid JavaScript iOS or Android app. To view the documentation, start the Gateway and navigate to http://localhost:8001/documentation.
