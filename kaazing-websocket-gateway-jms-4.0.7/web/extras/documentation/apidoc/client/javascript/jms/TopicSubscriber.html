<h2>Class TopicSubscriber</h2>



<p>
A client uses a <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> object to receive messages thathave been published to a topic. A <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> object is thepublish/subscribe form of a message consumer. A <CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE>can be created by using <CODE>Session.createConsumer</CODE>.<P>A <CODE>TopicSession</CODE> allows the creation of multiple<CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> objects per topic.  It will deliver eachmessage for a topic to eachsubscriber eligible to receive it. Each copy of the messageis treated as a completely separate message. Work done on one copy hasno effect on the others; acknowledging one does not acknowledge theothers; one message may be delivered immediately, while another waitsfor its subscriber to process messages ahead of it.<P>Regular <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> objects are not durable. Theyreceive only messages that are published while they are active.<P>If a client needs to receive all the messages published on a topic,including the ones published while the subscriber is inactive, it usesa durable <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE>. The JMS provider retains a record ofthis durablesubscription and insures that all messages from the topic's publishersare retained until they are acknowledged by this durablesubscriber or they have expired.<P>Sessions with durable subscribers must always provide the same clientidentifier. In addition, each client must specify a name that uniquelyidentifies (within client identifier) each durable subscription it creates.Only one session at a time can have a <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> for aparticular durable subscription.<P>A client can change an existing durable subscription by creating adurable <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> with the same name and a new topicand/or messageselector. Changing a durable subscription is equivalent to unsubscribing(deleting) the old one and creating a new one.<P>The <CODE>unsubscribe</CODE> method is used to delete a durablesubscription. The <CODE>unsubscribe</CODE> method can be used at the<CODE>Session</CODE> or <CODE>TopicSession</CODE> level.This method deletes the state beingmaintained on behalf of the subscriber by its provider.<P>Creating a <CODE>MessageConsumer</CODE> provides the same features ascreating a <CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE>. To create a durable subscriber,use of <CODE>Session.createDurableSubscriber</CODE> is recommended. The<CODE>TopicSubscriber</CODE> is provided to support existing code.</p>
